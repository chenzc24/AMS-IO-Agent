Task: 
1. Phase 1: Design unit H-shape capacitor without shield with target capacitance of 0.7 fF
2. Phase 2: Generate dummy capacitor based on the unit capacitor

Design constraints:
- Target capacitance: 0.7 fF
- Height constraint: less than 2 µm
- Low parasitic capacitance to ground required

Configuration:
- Technology: 28nm process node
- Library: LLM_Layout_Design
- Cell names: C_MAIN_0_7fF_H_shieldless (unit), C_DUMMY_0_7fF_H_shieldless (dummy)

Phase 1 - Unit Capacitor:
1. Generate unit H-shape capacitor without shield SKILL code with target capacitance of 0.7 fF
2. Execute the generated SKILL code using run_il_file or run_il_with_screenshot tool
3. Run DRC verification using run_drc tool on the unit cell
4. Run PEX extraction using run_pex tool on the unit cell
5. Verify capacitance meets target (0.7 fF) and iterate if necessary

Phase 2 - Dummy Capacitor:
1. Generate dummy capacitor SKILL code based on the unit capacitor
2. Execute the generated SKILL code
3. Run DRC verification on the dummy cell
4. Run PEX extraction on the dummy cell
