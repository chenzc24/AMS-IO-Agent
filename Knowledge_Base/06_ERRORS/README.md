# Common Errors Knowledge Base

This directory contains error summaries and solutions documented by the agent during execution.

## Purpose

When the agent encounters errors or issues during task execution, it should:
1. Document the error in this directory
2. Provide a clear description of what went wrong
3. Explain the root cause
4. Document the solution or workaround
5. Note any patterns or recurring issues

## File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `YYYYMMDD_error_description.md`
- Or by category: `knowledge_loading_errors.md`, `skill_generation_errors.md`, etc.

## Structure

Each error document should include:
- Error description
- Context (when/where it occurred)
- Root cause analysis
- Solution or workaround
- Prevention strategies

## Usage

The agent should read this directory at startup to learn from past errors and avoid repeating them.
